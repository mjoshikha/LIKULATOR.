# LIKULATOR.
Aspire for Her is a non-profit working to motivate women to enter & persevere in the workforce — turning aspirations to action! 
And an Organization with such and inspiring and powerful intent should definitely reach the masses.

One of the many ways to do that, is through social media. But creating an account and posting content without any insights over how your posts are doing and how many readers its attracting, isn't good enough.
But, there is a solution, choose LIKULATOR.

Likulator is an ML based model which estimates the organization's post performance, calculates its reach and gives you back reviews from the intended demographic.
Basically it provides you with the inputs and insights of said content, to help you better judge your next and upcoming posts. If you could easily find the most liked features of your content and positively commented upon posts, to help you better design and manipulate your ongoing projects, wouldn't that be neat? 
Well, that is exactly what Likulator is all about!
Likes and Comments is revolutionizing everything. Its engaging. Its feedback. But most importantly, its the input. But all this data, is not used to its potential.
Yes, Likes and Comments are displayed, but what if there were thousands of them, how would you analyse then?

Aspire For Her, has more than 500 posts, and 2500 followers. 
Which means it is input from 2500 different sources, leaving their likes and comments on more than 500 different designs. Now, think about the people who saw and didn't like. What if we can use that data. All these different attributes, will give rise to this new entire data set with with the correct machine learning models and algorithms can do wonders in get us the most accurate insights to expand our outreach, which is the goal!
We've covered the what and why, let's see the how.

LIKULATOR uses a variety of algorithms. The three main algorithms used as of now are, Upper Confidence Bound, Natural Language Processing and Support Vector Machine Classifier.

With Upper Confidence Bound, we are trying to find the post with the highest reward rate. Let's say, AFH posted 10 different posts on the same subject matter, whenever a reader or a follower finds the post on his/her feed, they either like it, or scroll through because they are unimpressed. But now we have the all this data, we use Likulator.

Likulator's UCB algorithm runs this data, and provides the above seen insight. Now, we can see that, one post seems to be working better than the others. AFH can now recreate similar posts to the best-performing post, increase their engagement rate, and hence get promoted to a variety of demographics. This post trial exemplifies decision-making under uncertainty.

For the comments, we use Natural Language Processing and SVM training classifier, to see how many positive and negative comments the post received, and project its infographics, without even having to read a single comment! Neat, right?

Sentiment Analysis, already a booming talk point in social media analytics, here NLP is being used extensively to determine the “sentiment” behind the comments that the users leave behind on AFH's posts. The Data Set will contain sample comments, categorized as 1 or 0, 1 as in positive comment, 0 as in negative comment. And using this, Likulator would predict the sentiment for the newly added comments. Fascinating!

Next, the SVM training algorithm using machine learning tools i.e. scikit-learn compatible with Python, builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier. We use this to classify the previously predicted comments as positive and negative. There are multiple classifier algorithms, but the best fit for this particular situation was SVM Classifier, its accuracy rate was 79%! 

But I did try and execute the data with other classifier algorithms, here's their accuracy rates. Obviously, I chose the one with the highest rate, SVM Classifier.

SVM Classifier                                                    79.0%
Kernel SVM Classifier                                             78.0%
Logistic Regression                                               77.5%
Decision Tree Classifier                                          75.0%
Naive Bayes Classifier                                            73.0%
Random Forest Classifier                                          72.5%
K-Nearest Neighbour Classifier                                    66.0%        

Now, using this, AFH can analyse their posts and understand why these posts received negative comments, and make alterations and improvements. 

And that's it! An application running with such great potential to give extensive results, to make promotions easier. We can of course make improvements, add more data, improve accuracy, or even change the pathway through which we obtain these data. Likulator is a stepping stone! 

Adjusting your posts to increase likes and positive comments can massively improve the promotions of AFH. We can attract members in masses, when our best-performing posts are promoted, which is well appreciated, because together we will be helping women everywhere! 

So, Let's us Women Empower Women! Choose Likulator!
